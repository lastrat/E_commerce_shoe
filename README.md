# Shoe-Paradise-app
Shoe Paradise is a shoe management app in java which main objective is to implement the CRUD operations in.
To set up our environment, we need the following:
* JDK >=11
* Glassfish 7.0
* Apache NetBeans 20
    When the project is imported into Apache NetBeans, the different pages can be found in the folder "Web pages" and the different servlets are in the folder "src".
In the repository, there is an .sql file for the database. The users of the platform are classified into 2 roles(user and admin) from which credentials can be taken when testing the app.

Note: To add a product image you must change the path that was defined in by default with the absolute path of the project for it to work perfectly(addShoe.java, updateShoes2.java).
